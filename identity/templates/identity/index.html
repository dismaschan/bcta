        <p class="mb-5 text-yellow-400">This project was developed by Cecilia, Chacha, Jackson, Maggie, and Naomi. The team worked collaboratively to create a simple but effective demonstration of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The SHA-256 hashing algorithm is a widely used method of encryption that converts any input data into a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash. This hash is unique to the input data, which makes it a valuable tool in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
